    PIL read-only image support for Microsoft Windows .ico files.

    By default the largest resolution image in the file will be loaded. This
    can be changed by altering the 'size' attribute before calling 'load'.

    The info dictionary has a key 'sizes' that is a list of the sizes available
    in the icon file.

    Handles classic, XP and Vista icon formats.

    When saving, PNG compression is used. Support for this was only added in
    Windows Vista.
